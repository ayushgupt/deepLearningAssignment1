This contains Google Collab Notebook for my Deep Leaning Assignment of implementing Neural Networks from scratch

It contains a neural Network for 9 Upper case characters of Emnist Dataset.  

The Neural network contains Relu activation in all the layers except the final and uses Softmax in the final layer with cross entropy loss function.

It uses SGD with L2 regularization for training. I have also added dropout using mask layers while both forward propagation and backward gradient pass.
